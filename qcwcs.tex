\subsubsection*{Abstract}
The safety of a quantum key distribution system relies on the fact that any eavesdropping attempt on the quantum channel creates errors in the transmission. For a given error rate, the amount of information that may have leaked to the eavesdropper depends on both the particular system and the eavesdropping strategy. In this work, we discuss quantum cryptographic protocols based on the transmission of weak coherent states and present anew system, based on a symbiosis of two existing ones, and for which the information available to the eavesdropper is significantly reduced. This system is therefore safer than the two previous ones. We also suggest a poss experimental implementation.

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
The only known method to exchange secret information through a communication channel in a proven secure way, is to use the so-called one-time pad (for a good review of both classical and quantum cryptography, see [1]). In this technique, the data, which is represented by a string of bits, is combined with a random string of bits of equal length called the key, and is then sent through the communication channel. The randomness of the key ensures that the encoded message is also completely random and as such totally unintelligible to a potential eavesdropper. The safety of the transmission is thus entirely dependent on the safety of the key, which has to be secret and shared just by both legitimate users. Moreover,safety can be guaranteed only if the key is used once, and then discarded. The problem is therefore how to distribute the random key between users in a secure way. Classically,the only possibility is either through personal meetings, or through a trusted courier, which makes the technique rather expensive, and not practical for many applications. Therefore,most practical cryptographic systems nowadays rely on different principles [1]. However,these cannot really guarantee the safety of the transmission, but rely on a weaker property of the system, namely that it is computationally safe. This means that the system can be broken in principle, but that the computation time required to do so is too long to pose a real threat. The main problem with this approach is that its safety could be destroyed by technological progress (faster computers) or mathematical advances (faster algorithms or future theoretical progress in computation theory). Another technique, whose safety does not rely on computing abilities, and which was only recently developed, is quantum cryptography(for an introduction, see [2]).

In quantum cryptography, the two users, generally referred to as Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver), have two kinds of communication channels at their disposal. One is a classical public channel, which can be overheard by anybody, but cannot be modified;and the second is a quantum channel, whose main characteristic is that any attempt at eavesdropping will create errors in the transmission. The quantum channel will be used to transmit the secret key, and the classical public channel will be used to exchange information and to send the encoded message. In principle, this is sufficient to ensure the safety of a transmission: Alice and Bob exchange a series of bits over the quantum channel, and then use part of the transmission to test for eavesdropping. If they find any discrepancy between their strings, they can infer that an eavesdropper, usually referred to as Eve, was listening and that their transmission is not secret. If they detect no errors, they can assume that the key is safe. By testing a large proportion of their initial string, they can attain any safety level they wish. Unfortunately, quantum channels are very sensitive devices, and due to the imperfections of the channels and of the detectors, some errors will always be unavoidable.

The problem facing Alice and Bob is therefore, for a given error rate, to estimate the amount of information that may have leaked to Eve, and decide on the safety of the transmission.

This of course depends on both the particular system used by Alice and Bob, and on the eavesdropping strategy adopted by Eve. A safer system is a system for which the amount of information that may have leaked to Eve is lower. If the information leaked to Eve is not too high, Alice and Bob can use classical information processing techniques to reduce it to approximately zero, at the expense of shortening their strings [3–5].
At present, there exist three different quantum cryptographic systems. The first one relies on the transmission of single photons randomly polarized along four directions [6].
As single photons are difficult to produce experimentally, a slight modification of this system, using weak pulses instead of single photons, was the first one to be implemented in practice [3,7,8]. The second system, which is conceptually the simplest, uses only two non orthogonal quantum states [9]. Its implementation relies on weak coherent pulses, with a phase difference between them [9,10]. The third system is based on the creation of pairs of EPR correlated photons [11]. One of its potential advantages is that the correlations are between single photons and not weak pulses, which can be a great advantage, as we shall emphasize later. However, creation and transmission over long distances of EPR correlated pairs is technologically more difficult, and it is not clear yet whether this will prove practical [12]. In this work, we focus on quantum cryptographic schemes implemented with weak pulses of coherent light. We compare the safety of the first and the second of these quantum cryptographic systems, and present a new system, which is a symbiosis of both, and for which the safety can be significantly increased.

In Section II, we analyze the first system, referred to as 4-states system. In Section III,we turn to the second one, named 2-states system, and present a new implementation.
We introduce our new 4+2 system in Section IV, and show that it is more sensitive to eavesdropping than the two previous ones. In Section V, we show the dangers associated with a lossy transmission line, and conclude in Section V

\subsubsection*{4-STATES PROTOCOL}

This protocol was developed by Bennett et al. [6]. The sender, Alice, chooses at random one out of four states, e.g. for polarized photons: |, <->, / or /, and sends it to the receiver, Bob. The two states - and | stand for bit value ‘0’, while the other two, <-> and /, stand for ‘1’. Bob chooses, also at random, a basis in which he measures the polarization. When his basis corresponds to Alice’s, his bit should be perfectly correlated with hers, whereas when his basis is the conjugate, there is no correlation between his result and Alice’s original choice. By discussing over the public channel, Alice and Bob agree to discard all the instances where they did not use the same basis (half of the total on average).

The result is what we call the sifted key, which should be two perfectly correlated strings,but which may contain errors. The two fundamental properties of this protocol are:(i) the choice of basis is completely hidden from the other protagonist (the two bases correspond to the same density matrix), as well as from any mischievous eavesdropper,Eve;(ii) when Alice and Bob use different bases, there is no correlation between their bits.

The first one, (i), ensures that, as the eavesdropper Eve cannot know which basis was used,she will unavoidably introduce errors. The second one, (ii), is not really necessary, but is preferable, as it reduces the information available to Eve to a minimum [13] (25 \% for each photon on which she eavesdropped). There have been various works analyzing eavesdropping strategies, calculating the information available to Eve as a function of the error rate and developing information processing techniques to reduce it to any required level [3–5,14].

One technical difficulty with this scheme is that in principle it should be implemented by means of single photons [6]. As these are difficult to generate experimentally, existing schemes rely on weak pulses of coherent or thermal light, with much less than one photon per pulse on average [3,7,8]. This ensures that the probability of having two or more photons in a pulse remains very small. This strategy reduces the transmission rate (recent experiments use about one tenth of a photon per pulse), while providing no advantage to an honest participant. More precisely, if Alice and Bob use coherent pulses, the transmission rate t, where the factor 1/2 comes from the fact that half of the transmissions had to be discarded(when Alice and Bob used different bases). In fact, even for these weak pulses, the probability of having two or more photons per pulse may not always be neglected (for the above pulses,one out of twenty non-zero pulses will have two photons). We shall show in Section V how to take this into account.

In order to get quantitative results, we shall assume that Eve uses the intercept resend strategy: she intercepts the pulses, attempts to gain as much information as possible, and sends to Bob a new pulse, prepared according to the information she obtained. Moreover,we shall assume that she eavesdrops in the bases used by Alice and Bob. This is the intercept/resend strategy which provides her with the most information on the sifted key [5]. However, it is not yet known whether this is the optimal strategy. It is easy to see that, when Eve eavesdrops on a fraction n of the transmissions, the error rate created is n/4 (when Eve uses the correct basis, she does not introduce any error, while she creates a 50\% error rate when she uses the wrong basis), and that the information she obtained is n/2 (she has total information when she used the correct basis, and none when she used the wrong one). Moreover, the scheme is completely symmetric, so that Eve shares the same information with Alice and with Bob. Therefore, we can write the mutual information shared by Alice and Eve and shared by Eve and Bob as a function of the error rate Q:I
(4)AE(Q) = I(4)EB(Q) = 2Q . (2)In this system, the intensity of the weak pulses, or equivalently the transmission rate t(4)defined in (1) has no influence. In the following, we will compare (2) to the information obtained by Eve for the other two system.

\subsubsection*{2-STATES PROTOCOL}
In this protocol [9], Alice chooses between only two non-orthogonal states, and sends one to Bob. As these are not orthogonal, there is no way for Bob to decode them deterministically. 

However, by means of a generalized measurement, also known as positive operator valued measure or POVM [15,16], he can perform a test which will sometimes fail to give an answer, and at all other times give the correct one. In essence, instead of having a binary test (with results 0 or 1), which will unavoidably create errors when the two states are not orthogonal, Bob has a ternary system, with possible results: 0, 1, or ? (with ? corresponding to inconclusive results). For example, if Alice sends a 0, Bob may get either a 0 or an inconclusive result, but he will never get a 1. We present a practical implementation of such a POVM in the next Section (for a theoretical description see [15,16]). As with the previous system, Alice and Bob use their public channel to discard all the inconclusive results. They should now have two perfectly correlated strings, except for possible errors. The safety of the protocol against eavesdropping is ensured by the fact that Eve cannot get deterministic results either. She may attempt to get as much information as possible by projecting the states onto an orthogonal basis. This is discussed in Section III C, where we show that this will unavoidably create errors. Another possibility for Eve is to mimic Bob’s measurement,and obtain deterministic results on a fraction of the bits. 

However, in this case, she will have to guess Alice’s choice on the remaining bits, and this will provide her with less information than the previous strategy. Let us emphasize that, as we want Eve’s guesses to result in errors on Bob’s side, this scheme should not be implemented with weak pulses only. In this case, Eve could simply intercept the transmission, resend a pulse to Bob only when she managed to obtain the bit sent by Alice (i.e. 0 or 1), and send nothing when she obtained an inconclusive result. The signature of eavesdropping would then just be a reduction in the transmission rate. In the original proposal, this is overcome by using phase encoding of a weak pulse (the two states are, with overlap e 2a ), which is sent together with a strong pulse, used also as a phase reference [9,10]. When Eve fails to obtain information,she still has to send the strong pulse, which will create errors in the reception. Ekert etal. [16] recently analyzed various eavesdropping strategies related to this system. Here, we shall restrict ourselves to the intercept/resend strategy and compare the safety of various schemes.

Let us now suggest a new implementation of the 2 states system, which will be later extended to our new 4 + 2 protocol. We shall call it parallel reference implementation, to distinguish it from the sequential reference implementation of [9]. Alice uses weak coherent states, with phase encoding 0 or pi with respect to a strong coherent state. We denote the weak states  and the strong state.

Instead of sending the two states one after the other, Alice uses two orthogonal polarizations: |, say, will have vertical polarization, and b will have horizontal polarization.

The decoding on Bob’s side is schematized in Fig. 1. The two states are separated by a polarization beam splitter (PBS). b is rotated to vertical polarization and sent through a mainly transmitting beam splitter (BS1) to detector D1. A small fraction of b, equal to 'a', is sent to interfere with 'a' at BS2, and towards two detectors D2 and D3. A count in D2, say, corresponds to phase zero, while a count in D3 corresponds to pi. No count in both D2 and D3 is of course an inconclusive result. It is easy to calculate the probability of such a result: which is equal to the overlap between the two states. It was shown that (4) represents the optimum for separating deterministically two non-orthogonal states [17]. Since all the cases corresponding to inconclusive results have to be discarded, the transmission rate of the channel is given by:

Detector D1 should always fire, and can therefore be used as a trigger for the other two,enabling them only for a short time corresponding to the length of the pulse (this will reduce the dark counts). Moreover, an eavesdropper with an inconclusive result would still have to send b, which will result in random counts in D2 and D3. A small modification of the above will be used for our 4 + 2 protocol.

As in Section II, we assume that Eve performs an intercept/resend strategy, and attempts to get as much information as possible on the state sent by Alice. This is obtained by projecting it onto the orthogonal basis B sym = (i, j) as shown in Fig. 2 [15], and provides Eve with probabilistic information only. Another method for Eve would be to use the same POVM as Bob. This would provide her with a smaller amount of deterministic information.
The error rate introduced by Eve is equal to the probability of making the wrong reading,e.g. the probability of obtaining j when the input was in fact . With this particular eavesdropping strategy,the transmission channel Alice-Eve is known as a binary symmetric channel, and is fully characterized by the error rate q [18]. The mutual information shared by Alice and Eve is equal to the channel capacity and is given by [16]:
b is the maximum information that can be extracted from two states with overlap cos b. On the other hand, after Bob discards all his inconclusive results, the transmission channel Eve-Bob is perfect. Therefore the mutual information Eve-Bob is:i EB = 1 .
(8)This strategy, where Eve eavesdrops on all the transmitted photons, will create a high error rate. In order to reduce it, Eve shall only eavesdrop on a fraction n of the transmissions,thus creating an error rate Q = nq = n

It is now easy to obtain the mutual information between Alice and Eve, I AE and between(2)Eve and Bob, I EB , as a function of the error rate Q and the angle b between the states: we can also write the mutual information as a function of the transmission rate for each value of the error rate. These functions are plotted in Fig 3, where the information gained for the 4-states system is used as a references
