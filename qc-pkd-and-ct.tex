\subsubsection*{Abstract}
When elementary quantum systems, such as polarized photons, are used to transmit digital information, the uncertainty principle gives rise to novel cryptographic phenomena unachievable with traditional transmission media, e.g. a communications channel on which it is impossible in principle to eavesdrop without a high probability of disturbing the transmission in such a way as to be detected. Such a quantum channel can be used in conjunction with ordinary insecure classical channels to distribute random key information between two users with the assurance that it remains unknown to anyone else, even when the users share no secret information initially. We also present a protocol for coin-tossing by exchange of quantum messages, which is secure against traditional kinds of cheating, even by an opponent with unlimited computing power, but ironically can be subverted by use of a still subtler quantum phenomenon, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Conventional cryptosystems such as ENIGMA,DES, or even RSA, are based on a mixture of guess­work and mathematics. Infonu.tion theory shows that traditional secret-key cryptosystems car.not be to­tally secure unless the key, used once only, is at least as long as the clear text. On the other hand,the theory of computational complexity is not yet well enough understood to prove the computational security of public-key cryptosystems.

In this paper we use a radically different foundation for cryptography, viz. the uncertainty principle of quantum physics. In conventional information  theory and cryptography,· it is taken for granted that digital communications in principle can always be passively monitored or copied, even by someone ignorant of their meaning. However, when information is encoded in non-orthogonal quantum states, such as single photons with polarization directions 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees, one obtains a communications channel whose transmissions in prin­ciple cannot be read or copied reliably by an eaves­dropper ignorant of certain key information used informing the transmission. The eavesdropper cannot even gain partial information about such a transmis­sion without altering it a random and uncontrollable way likely to be detected by the channel's legiti­mate user.

Quantum coding was first described in (W),along with two applications: making money that is in principle impossible to counterfeit, and multi plex­ing two or three messages in such a way that reading one destroys the others. More recently [BBBW],quantum coding has been used in conjunction with public key cryptographic techniques to yield several schemes,s for unforgeable subway tokens. Here we show that quantum coding by itself achieves one of the main advantages of public key cryptography by per­mitting secure distribution of random key informa­tion between parties who share no secret information initially, provided the parties have access, besides the quantum channel, to an ordinary channel suscep­tible to passive but not active eavesdropping. Even in the presence of active eavesdropping, the two parties can still distribute key securely if they share some secret information initially, provided the eavesdropping is not so active as to suppress communications completely. We also present a proto­col for coin tossing by exchange of quantum mes­sages. Except where otherwise noted the protocols are provably secure even against an opponent with superior technology and unlimited computing power,barring fundamental violations of accepted physical laws.

Offsetting these advantages is the practical disadvantage that quantum transmissions are neces­sarily very weak and cannot be amplified in transit. Moreover, quantum cryptography does not provide di­gital signatures, or applications such as certified mail or the ability to settle disputes before a judge.

\subsubsection{Essential Properties of Polarized Photons}

Polarized light can be produced by sending an ordinary light beam through a polarizing apparatus such as a Polaroid filter or calcite crystal; the beam's polarization axis is determined by the orien­tation of the polarizing apparatus in which the beam originates. Generating single polarized photons is also possible, in principle by picking them out of a polarized beam, and in practice by a variation of. an experinient [AGR] of Aspect, et. a

Although polarization is a continuous varia­ble, the uncertainty principle forbids measurements on any single photon from revealing more than one bit about its polarization. For example, if a light beam with polarization axis is a sent into a filter oriented at angle P, the individual photons behave dichotomously and probabilistically, being transmit­ted with probability cos 2 (a-P) and absorbed with the complementary probability sin 7 («-P). The photons behave deterministically only when the two axes arc parallel (certain transmission) or perpendicular (certain absorbtion).

If the two axes are not perpendicular, so that some photons are transmitted, one might hope to learn additional information about a by measuring the transmitted photons again with a polarizer ori­ented at some third angle; but this is to no avail,because the transmitted photons, in passing through polariza­polarizer, emerge with exactly polarization, having lost all memory of their previous po­larization a.

Another way one might hope to learn more than one bit from a single photon would be not to measure it directly, but rather somehow amplify it into a clone of identically polarized photons, then perform measurements on these; but this hope is also vain,because such cloning can be shown to be inconsistent with the foundations of quantum mechanics [WZ) .

Formally, quantum mechanics represents the internal state of a quantum system (e.g. the polarization ­of unit length df a photon) as a vector in a linear space H over the field of complex num­bers (Hilbert space). The inner product of two vec j+j where, is defined as complex conjugation. The dimensionality of the Hilbert space depends on the system, being larg­er (or even infinite) for more complicated systems. Each physical measurement H that might be performed on the system corresponds to resolution of its Hilbert space into orthogonal subspaces, one foreach possible outcome of the measurement. The num­ber of possible outcomes is thus limited to the dimensionality d of the Hilbert space, the most complete measurements being those that resolve the Hilbert space into d 1-dimensional subspaces.

The Hilbert space for a single polarized pho­ton is 2-dimensional; thus the state of a photon maybe completely described as a linear combination of,for example, the two unit vectors r1  (1,0) and r2 = (0,1), representing respectively horizontal and vertical. In particular, a photon  polarized at angle a to the horizontal is described (cosa, sina). When subjected to a measurement of vertical-vs.-horizontal polari­zation, such a photon in effect chooses to become horizontal with probability cos 2 a and vertical with probability sin 2 a. The two orthogonal vectors r1 and r2 thus a exemplify the resolution of a 2-dimensional Hilbert space into'2 orthogonal 1-dimensional subspaces; henceforth r1 and r2 will be said to comprise the 'rectilinear' basis for the Hilbert space.

An alternative basis for the same Hilbert space is provided by the two 'diagonal' basis vec­tors d1 (0. 707 ,0.'707), representing a 45-degree photon, and d2 (0.707,-0.707), representing a 135-degree photon. Two bases (e.g. rectilinear and diagonal) are said to be 'conjugate' (WI, if each vector of one basis has equal-length projections onto all vectors of the other basis: this means that a system prepared in a specific state of one basis will behave entirely randomly, and lose all its stored information, when subjected to a measurement corresponding to the other basis. Owing to the com­plex nature of its coefficients, the two-dimensional Hilbert space also admits a third basis conjugate to both the rectilinear and diagonal bases, comprising the two so-called 'circular' polarizations c1 (0.707,0.707i) and c2 (0.707i,0.70"1); but the rectilinear and diagonal bases are all that will be needed for the cryptographic applications in this paper.

The Hilbert space for a compound system is constructed by taking the tensor product of the Hil­bert spaces of its components; thus the state of a pair of photons is characterized by a-unit vector in the 4-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by the or­thogonal basis vectors r1r 1, r 1r2 , r2r1 , and r 2 r 2 . This formalism entails that the state of a compound system is not generally expressible as the cartesian product of the states of its parts: e.g. the·Einstei'n-Podolsky-Rosen state of two photons, 0.7071(r1r 2 -r2 r1), to be discussed later, is not equivalent to any product of one-photon state.

\subsubsection{Quantum Public Key Distribution}

In traditional public-key cryptography, trap ­door functions arc used to conceal the meaning of messages between two users from a passive eavesdrop­per, depite the lack of any initial shared secret information between the two users. In quantum pub­lic key distribution, the quantum channel is not used directly to send meaningful messages, but is rather used to transmit a supply of random bits be­tween two users who share no secret information ini­tially, in such a way that the users, by subsequent consultation over an ordinary non-quantum channel subject to passive eavesdropping, can tell with high,probability whether the original quantum transmis­sion has been disturbed in transit, as it would be by an eavesdrooper (it is the quantum channel's pe­culiar virtue to compel eavesdroppinq to be active). If the transmission has not been disturbed, they agree to use these shared secret bits in the well ­known way as a one-time pad to conceal the meaning of subsequent meaningful communications, or for oth­er cryptographic applications (e.g. authentication tags) requiring shared secret random information. If transmission has been disturbed, they discard it and try again, deferring any meaningful communica­tions until they have succeeded in transmitting enough random bits through the quantum channel to serve as a one-time pad.

In more detail one user ('Alice') chooses a random bit string and a random sequence of polariza­tion bases (rectilinear or diagonal). She then sends the other user (Bob) a train of photons, eachrepresenting one bit of the string in the basis cho­sen for that bit position, a horizontal or 45-degree photon standing for a binary zero and a vertical or 135-degree photon standing for a binary 1. As Bob receives the photons he decides, randomly for each photon and independently of Alice, whether to meas­ure the photon's rectilinear polarization or its diagonal polarization, and interprets the result of the measurement as a binary zero or one. As ex­plained in the previous section a random answer is produced and all information lost when one attempts to measure the rectilinear polarization of a diago­nal photon, or vice versa. Thus Bob obtains mean­ingful data from only half the photons he detects-­those for which he guessed the correct polarization basis. Bob's information is further degraded by the fact that, realistically, some of the photons would be lost in transit or would fail to be counted by Bob's imperfectly-efficient detectors.

Subsequent steps of the protocol take place over an ordinary public communications channel, as­sumed to be susceptible to eavesdropping but not to the injection or alteration of messages. Bob and Alice first determine, by public exchange of mes­sages, which photons were successfully received and of these which were received with the correct basis. If the quantum transmission has been undisturbed, Alice and Bob should agree on the bits encoded by these photons, even this data has never been dis­cussed over the public channel. Each of these pho­tons, in other words, presumably carries one bit of random information (e.g. whether a rectilinear pho­ton was vertical or horizontal) known to Alice and Bob but to no one else.

Because of the random mix of rectilinear and diagonal photons in the quantum transmission, any eavesdropping carries the risk of altering the transmission in such a way as to produce disagree­ment between Bob and Alice on some of the bits on which they think they should agree. Specifically,it can be shown that no measurement on a photon in transit, by an eavesdropper who is informed of the photon's original basis only after he has performed his measurement, can yield more than 1/2 expected bits of information about the key bit encoded by that photon; and that any such measurement yielding b bits of expected information (b s 1/2) must induce a disagreement with probability at least b/2 if the measured photon, or an attempted forgery of it,is later re-measured in its original basis. (This optimum trade off occurs, for example, when the ea­vesdropper measures and retransmits all intercepted photons in the rectilinear basis, thereby learning the correct polarizations of half the photons and inducing disagreements in 1/4 of those that are lat­er re-measured in the original basis.)

Alice and Bob can therefore test for eaves­dropping by publicly comparing some of the bits on which they think they should agree, though of course this sacrifices the secrecy of these bits. The bit positions used in this comparison should be a random subset (say one third) of the correctly received bits, so that eavesdropping on more than a few pho­tons is unlikely to escape detection. If all the comparisons agree, Alice and Bob can conclude that the quantum transmission has been free of signifi­cant eavesdropping; and those of the remaining bits that were sent and received with the same basis also agree, and can safely be used as a one time pad for subsequent secure communications over the public channel. When this one-time pad is used up, the protocol is repeated to send a new body of random information over the quantum channel.

The need for the public (non-quantum) channel in this scheme to be immune to active eavesdropping can be relaxed if the Alice and Bob have agreed be­fore hand on a small secret key, which they use ·to create Wegman-Carter authentication tags WCI for their messages over the public channel. In more detail the Weqman-Carter multiple-message authenti­cation scheme uses a small random key to produce a message-dependent 'tag' (rather like a check sum)for an arbitrary large message, in such a way that an eavesdropper ignorant of the key has only a small probability of being able to generate any other va­lid message-tag pairs. The tag thus provides evi­dence that the message is legitimate, and was not generated or altered by someone ignorant of the key. (Key bits are gradually used up in the Wegman-Carter scheme, and cannot be reused without compromising the system's provable security; however, in the present application, these key bits can be replaced by fresh random bits successfully transmitted through the quantum channel.) The eavesdropper can still prevent communication by suppressing messages in the public channel, as of course he can by sup­pressing or excessively perturbing the photons sent through the quantum channel. However, in either case, Alice and Bob will conclude with high proba­bility that their secret communications are being suppressed, and will not be fooled into thinking their communications are secure when in fact they're not.

\subsubsection{Quantum Coin Tossing}

'Coin Flipping by Telephone' was first dis­cussed by Blum [Bl]. The problem is for two dis­trustful parties, communicating at a distance with­out the help of a third party, to come to agree on a winner and a loser in such a way that each party has exactly 50 per cent chance of winning. Any attempt by either party to bias the outcome should be de­tected by the other party as cheating. Previous protocols for this problem are based on unproved assumptions in computational complexity theory, which makes them vulnerable to a breakthrough in algorithm design.

1. Alice chooses randomly one basis (say rectili­near) and a sequence of random bits (one thousand should be sufficient). She then encodes her bits as a sequence of photons in this same basis, using the same coding scheme as before. She sends the result­ing train of polarized photons to Bob.

2. Bob chooses, independently and randomly for each photon, a sequence of reading bases. He reads the photons accordingly, recording the results in two tables, one of rectilinearly received photons and one of diagonally received photons. Because of losses in his detectors and of the transmission channel, some of the photons may not be received a tall, resulting in holes in his tables. At this time, Bob makes his guess as to which basis Alice used, and announces it to Alice. He wins if heguessed correctly, loses otherwise.

3. Alice reports to Bob whether he won, by telling him which basis she had actually used. She certif­ies this information by sending Bob, over a classi­cal channel, her entire original bit sequence used in step 1.

4. Bob verifies that no cheating has occurred by comparing Alice's sequence with both his tables. There should be perfect agreement with the table corresponding to Alice's basis and no correlation with the other table. In our example, Bob can be confident that Alice's original basis was indeed rectilince  as claimed.

Alice could attempt cheating either at step 1 or step 2. Let us first assume that she follows step 1 honestly and finds herself losing at the end if step 2, because Bob made he correct guess, here rectiliniear. In order to pretend she has won, she would need to convince Bob that her photons were diagonally polarized, which she can only do by prod­ucing a sequence of bits in perfect agreement with Bob's diagonal table. This she cannot do reliably because this table is the result of probabilistic behavior of the photons after the left her hands. Suppose she goes ahead anyway and sends Bob a new 'original' sequence, different from the one that she used in step 1, in hopes that it will by luck agree perfectly with Bob's diaognal table. This attempt to cheat requires Alice to be not only lucky but daring, because in the vast majority of cases, the gamble would fail and would be detected as cheating. By contrast, in traditional coin-tossing schemes,analogous attempts to seize a lucky victory from the jaws of defeat, though unlikely to succeed, are unaccompanied by any danger of detection.

It is easy to see that things are even worse for Alice if she attempts to cheat in step 1, by sending a mixture of rectilinear and diagonal pho­tons, or photons which are polarized neither rectil­inearly or diagonally. In this case she will not be able to agree with either of Bob's tables in step 3,since both tables will record the results of proba­bilistic behavior not under her control.

In order to say how Alice can cheat using quantum mechanics it is necessary to describe the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) effect [Bo,AGR), often called a paradox because it contradicts the common ­sense notion that for two individually random events happening at distance from one another to be corre­lated, some physical influence must have propagated from the earlier event to the later, or else from some common random cause to both events.

The EPR effect occurs when certain types of atom or molecule decay with the emission of two pho­tons, and consists of the fact that the two photons are always found to have opposite polarization, re­gardless of the basis used to observe them, provided both are observed in the same basis. For example,if both Photons are measured rectilinearly, it will always be found that one is horizontal and the other vertical, though which is horizontal will vary ran­domly from one decay to the next. If both photons are measured diagonally, one will always be 135-degree and the other 45-degree. A moment's reflec­tion will show that this behavior cannot be explained by assuming the decay produce a distribution over a of oppositely polarized (a and a+90 1photons, since, in that case, if such a pair of photons were measured in an intermediate basis (say a+45), both would behave probabilistically so as to sometimes come out with the same polarization.

Probably the simplest, but paradoxical ­sounding, verbal explanation of the EPR effect is to say that the two photons are produced in an initial state of undefined polarization; and when one of them is measured, the measuring apparatus forces it to choose a polarization (choosing randomly and equiprobably between the two characteristic direc­tions offered by the apparatus) while simultaneously forcing the other unmeasured photon, no matter how far away, to choose the opposite polarization. This implausible-sounding explanation is supported by formal quantum mechanics, which represents the state of a pair of photons as a vector in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space obtained by taking the tensor product of two 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The EPR state produced by the decay is described by the vector 0.7071(r 1r2 - r2r1), and the EPR effect is explained by the fact that this vector has anticorrelated pro­jections into the 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces of the two photons no matter what basis is used to ex­press the tensor product.

In order to cheat, Alice produces a number of EPR photon-pairs instead of individual random pho­tons in step 1. In each case she sends Bob one mem­ber of the pair and stores the other herself, per­haps between perfectly reflecting mirrors.
